# Product-categorization_Transformer_Project
This is Product Categorization in Deep Learning Neural Network Model

Current step involved two parts with two different notebooks
1. Jupyter notebook with all the extracting and pre-processing the data 
2. Save final datasets in pickle and build & training model in colab notebook
